Welcome to my repository for The Enhanced Listbox demo.  
  
This project shows how you can create your own Enhanced Listbox using PAGE. It operates as a normal ScrolledListbox so when the user clicks with <Button-1> the selection shows in green (configurable) and when the user clicks with <Button-3> the items show up in blue (again configurable).  
  
All code is in Python. With a little bit of work this project can be used in just about any Tkinter program.
